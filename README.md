<h3 align="left">Description</h3>
<p>This is an almost simple site using JavaScript that follows the object-oriented programming (OOP) logic. In this project, inheritance is correctly implemented, and we have designed it in a way that polymorphism is controlled and used when needed.</p>
<br>

<h3 align="left">Api :</h3>
<p>The data is fetched from the data.json file, which acts as a local API, providing product information like name, price, and description. This information is used throughout the project to dynamically generate product listings and handle other operations such as adding items to the cart and calculating totals.</p>
